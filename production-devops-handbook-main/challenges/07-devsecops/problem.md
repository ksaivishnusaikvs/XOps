# DevSecOps Challenge

## Overview
Security integration throughout the development lifecycle remains one of the biggest challenges in modern DevOps practices.

## The Problem
- Security is often treated as an afterthought
- Vulnerability scanning slows down CI/CD pipelines
- Lack of security automation in development workflows
- Compliance requirements add complexity
- Security tools generate too many false positives
- Developer friction with security policies

## Impact
- Increased security vulnerabilities in production
- Delayed releases due to security gates
- Developer productivity loss
- Compliance violations and audit failures
- Security debt accumulation
