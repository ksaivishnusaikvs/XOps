# AI/ML/LLM Operations Challenge

## Overview
The explosion of AI/ML and LLM applications introduces unique operational challenges that traditional DevOps practices don't fully address.

## The Problem
- Model versioning and experiment tracking complexity
- Reproducibility issues in ML pipelines
- Data drift and model degradation in production
- Resource-intensive training and inference workloads
- LLM deployment and cost management challenges
- Lack of standardization in ML workflows
- Model monitoring and observability gaps
- Prompt engineering and version control
- Regulatory compliance for AI systems

## Impact
- Inconsistent model performance in production
- Difficulty reproducing results
- Excessive cloud costs for AI workloads
- Delayed time-to-market for ML features
- Model governance and compliance risks
- Poor visibility into model behavior
